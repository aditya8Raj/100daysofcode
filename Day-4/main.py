Instructions

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
1. Under 18.5 they are underweight
2. Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
3. Over 25 but below 30 they are overweight
4. Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
5. Above 35 they are clinically obese

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI = weight(kg) / height^2 (m^2)

NOTE: You should round the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese clinically obese.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
|-----------------|
|  weight = 80    |
|  height = 1.75  |
|-----------------|

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
80 / 1.75 * 1.75 = 27.755102040816325
|----------------------------------------------|
| Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight  |
|----------------------------------------------|

weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

bmi = round(weight / (height ** 2))

bmi = round(weight / (height ** 2))

if bmi <= 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif 25 <= bmi < 30:

elif 30 <= bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
