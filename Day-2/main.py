Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height e.g if a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI = weight(kg) / height^2(m^2)

1. Syntax Error
Syntax errors happen when your code
does not make any sense to the computer.
This can happen because you've misspelt
something or there's too many brackets or
a missing comma.

2. Name Error
This happens when there is a variable
with a name that the computer
does not recognise. It's usually because
you've misspelt the name of a variable
you created earlier.
Note: variable names are case sensitive!

3. Zero Division Error
This happens when you try to divide by zero,
This is something that is mathematically
impossible so Python will also complain.

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

TODO: You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

NOTE: Your output should match the words in the example output precisely. You should round the results to the nearest whole number.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
56
EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
