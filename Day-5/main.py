INSTRUCTIONS

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

NOTE: The first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the the example: Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice the concepts I have learnt so far, generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g
1 means Heads
0 means Tails

INSTRUCTIONS
You are going to write a program which will slelct a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

NOTE: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Split the string name_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names a name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

EXAMPLE INPUT:
Aditya, Ujjwal, Jay, Michael, Jenny

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
Ujjwal is going to buy the meal today!
