# Exercise 1
"""
Write a program that workrs out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
Even numebers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 / 2 = 43
43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the devision is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 / 2 = 36.875
36.875 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.875, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as percentage sign(%) is Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.
6 / 2 = 3 with no remainder

NOTE: Your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
EXAMPLE INPUT 1:
43
EXAMPLE OUTPUT 1:
This is an odd number.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT 2:
94
EXAMPLE OUTPUT 2:
This is an even number.
